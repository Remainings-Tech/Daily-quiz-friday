#1) Write a program that asks a user for two numbers. If the first one is larger, the program prints out "first one bigger!". Otherwise it prints out "second one bigger!".
# 12 minutes
firstnumber = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
secondnumber = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

#compare the number and checks which one has the biggest.
if firstnumber > secondnumber:
    print("The first one is bigger")
else:
    print("The second one is bigger")
