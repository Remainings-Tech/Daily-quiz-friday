#Question 2 (1 point) Write a program that asks a user for the number of ducks they want. The program then prints out that many "quacks". So for example, if the user types "3", the program would print out:
#7 minutes
duck = int(input("How many ducks do you want? "))

for i in range(duck):
    print("quack")
